				<h2>Personality Test</h2>
				<p>&emsp;In high school, I discovered that I enjoyed teaching,
					helping, and working with others after I worked with the A+ program
					tutoring kids. Whether it be helping people on their code, or
					working with teammates on the field, I enjoy working with others
					towards a common goal. Whether that goal may be to get better or to
					learn something new, I find it hard not to enjoy interacting with
					others and sharing new ideas. I took a personality test on
					high5test.com, and think that my result as a coach reflects this
					side of me.</p>

				<h3>Work Ethic</h3>
				<p>&emsp;I still remember my first pitch in the 4th grade, the
					ball slamming against the trash can. That weekend I got a call from
					coach that I would be pitching for the team. From then on I knew I
					was in it, truly a part of something that would stick with me.
					Everything from pitching, hitting, and fielding, being a competitor
					made me fall in love with baseball. As the years went by, after
					spending late nights taking lessons and spending hours during the
					day pitching against net or hitting off coach, the foundation for
					the work ethic that I have now would be cemented. When high school
					came around I knew that baseball was something that I had to work
					for, and it was something that I devoted myself to. From the live
					hitting at 6 AM to the winter practices at 7 PM, I worked hard. I
					spent hours after school everyday in the weight room. When I was
					done with that, no matter how bad the weather was, I spent even
					more hours in the cages. When they took down the cages for the
					winter, I'd spend hours practicing on the tennis courts instead.
					Through my hard work, I learned what it truly meant to work towards
					something that I love doing. I pride myself for sticking with it,
					through both the highs and the lows.</p>

				<h3>Computer Science & Me</h3>
				<p>It's hard to single out what specifically I enjoy about
					computer science. As someone who enjoys math and puzzles, analyzing
					data is both interesting and fun to me. That said, this has applied
					to several classes like computer architecture and programming
					classes. On another hand, because of my experience in the arts and
					creating content, I enjoy designing just as much. Regardless, I
					enjoy working and collaborating with others. Whether that be
					helping someone in a lab, or hopping on a zoom call to work on a
					project, I enjoy being able to help my peers while also being able
					to learn and share new ideas.</p>
