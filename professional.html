				<h1>Professional Statement</h1>
				<h2>Bits, Silicon, and Terminals</h2>
				&emsp; I still remember the day when math finally clicked for me, it
				was the 5th grade and around the time I started caring about my
				grades. I was working on a computer and I heard my teacher whisper
				to me from behind, it was my first perfect score on a math test.
				From then on, I started to pay more attention to math, and before I
				knew it, I've come to enjoy the process of problem solving that came
				with it. Later on, like most kids in high school, I didn’t put much
				thought into what I wanted to do. However, one thing I did know was
				that I enjoyed math. I enjoyed the problem-solving and the
				satisfaction of a problem coming together, but I had a hard time
				figuring out what I wanted to do with this passion. At the same
				time, I discovered my passion for baseball, and because I had
				concrete goals to strive for, I did everything to keep playing. I
				worked hard in school and spent hours after school practicing, all
				so I could play again. However, going into my junior year, I
				realized that I needed to find another passion outside of baseball.
				Because I hadn’t taken a computer class since middle school and I
				had already tried all the other technical classes in high school, I
				decided to take my first programming class. <br> <br>
				&emsp; Until then, I never thought that something would give me as
				much joy as playing baseball did, but I was wrong. Whether it was
				creating a snake game, building a robot, or helping my peers debug
				their code, I loved all of it. From then on, it was easy to decide
				that I would pursue a Computer Science degree at Missouri State.
				Today, no matter how many hours I may spend coding, helping someone
				in my lab with their code, or spending with a group studying data
				structures, I enjoy everything that I learn, and I look forward to
				learning more. Whether I end up on the back-end or front-end,
				analyzing data, or building new software, I think that I have a
				place anywhere, and I look forward to continuing my new passion.
